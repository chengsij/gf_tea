UI
The UI has these features:
- A dashboard of the items, tea, to choose from. 
- I can specify the name, type, and a picture of the tea.
- Each tea also allows me to enter a list of time in seconds to steep the tea.
- After I save the information and steep times of the tea, I can view when in the dashboard. 
- I can click on each of the steep time of the tea to start a countdown timer.
- The countdown timer should be visible in the dashboard no matter where I'm navigating on the dashboard.
- The timer should play a pleasant notification sound when the timer starts and ends. 
Create the UI using react and TypeScript.

Backend
Store all of the tea information in a yaml file. 
Do no create a database.
